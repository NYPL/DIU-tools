# Vendor-Digitization-NYPL

These are the tools I use when doing vendor digitization work at New York Public Library, as well as a few other scripts that have come in handy on occasion. 

They are roughly organized into the functions they serve, but some scripts can be used for a variety of applications. 
CSV_and_File_Counting
- - Scripts that will (recursively) get a variety of information from the file names and folder structures, and then (typically) give you an output in the form of a CSV. These scripts are mostly used for creating CSVs for metadata imports on to NYPL's metadata management system. 

File_Management
- - Scripts that will most certain extensions, move and flatten files in complicated folder structures, and reformat certain files. Mostly used to make sure that files are valid and fit NYPL specifications. 

MSU_Projects
- - These have been used for projects done in conjunction with the Metadata Services Unit at NYPL. These include file moving scripts, file rotating scripts, and some XML parsing scripts. 

OCR
- - These are the tools created for any/all OCR projects I've done while at NYPL. They include an OCR script, as well as some TXT file cleaning scripts. Also available is a READ_ME that outlines my process for handling OCR with a few different file formats

Other
- - The other scripts that aren't necessarily any of the above. Included is a vertical file splitter, a script for downloading PDFs, and a few file renamers. 

If there are any questions about the scripts here, feel free to reach out to the Mass Digitization Coordinator at New York Public Library.
